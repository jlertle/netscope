NetScope Kernel
================================================================================


Introduction
================================================================================
This folder contains the "netscope" kernel. Attention the kernel is an generic 
simulating kernel to mimic large scale complex real world network system. 

The kernel currently contains two parts:
- The interface for extension
- An basic implementation for the interfaces to help developing user own simulating 
applicatioins. You can extend these basic objects or implement the interface directly
to create your own components. 

The kernel also provide some mechanism to assemble components user selected into 
an entire application.
