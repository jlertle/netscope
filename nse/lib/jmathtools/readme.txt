What JMathTools IS

JMathTools is a collection of independent packages designed to fit common engineering/scientific computing needs. For now, JMathTools contains:

JMathArray: simple linear algebra for double[][] arrays using static methods
JMathPlot: interactive plot in 2D / 3D
JMathIO: binary and ASCII input/output for double arrays
JMathTools is designed to be:

easy to integrate in your java applications
easy to extend and modify
It was initially developed to provide easy to use java API in Matlab to Java porting task.

What JMathTools IS NOT

JMathTools was NOT designed to be:

a high performance computing engine
a high performance 3D visualization tool
For such things, many free Java packages are available (see Links).
