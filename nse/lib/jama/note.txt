JAMA : A Java Matrix Package
http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/

JAMA is a basic linear algebra package for Java. It provides user-level classes for constructing and manipulating real, dense matrices.  It is meant to provide sufficient functionality for routine problems, packaged in a way that is natural and understandable to non-experts.  It is intended to serve as the standard matrix class for Java, and will be proposed as such to the Java Grande Forum and then to Sun.  A straightforward public-domain reference implementation has been developed by the MathWorks and NIST as a strawman for such a class.  We are releasing this version in order to obtain public comment. There is no guarantee that future versions of JAMA will be compatible with this one.
